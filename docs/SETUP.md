# Helix Data Bridge Setup Guide

## Generating your API key
Your API key must have the following permissions: 
- Read-Only permissions to the Core Command endpoints. (Needed to get the org id of the API key)
- Read-Only permission to Camera endpoints. (Needed to check that configured context cameras are present in the org)
- Read-Write permission to the Helix endpoints. (Needed to create the configured helix events and event types)
